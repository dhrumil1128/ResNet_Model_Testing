# ResNet_Model_Testing
Requierments :

Minimum System Requirements Your ResNet model, once trained and saved, can be used on a machine with relatively modest specifications. You will need:

Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS, or a Linux distribution (Ubuntu is common).

RAM: 8 GB is the absolute minimum, but 16 GB is recommended for smooth operation, especially if you want to use the model within other applications or process a large number of images at once.

CPU: An Intel Core i5 or equivalent processor is sufficient. The model will run, but processing speed will be slower than with a GPU.

Hard Drive: A standard HDD or SSD is fine. Your 1TB HDD and 256GB SSD are more than enough. An SSD is highly recommended for faster loading times of the model file and the images.

GPU (Optional but Highly Recommended): A dedicated GPU is not strictly required to use the trained model for inference, but it will dramatically speed up the prediction process. For a smooth experience, a GPU with 4 GB of VRAM is a good starting point (e.g., an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or equivalent).
